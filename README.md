# Open Shapes & Beats

 A JSAB fangame made in Unity

Ever saw JSAB and said "Hey, I completed all the challenges, I played all the levels, now what?" So. Did. We. Well, this game (should) fix the empty void!

# FEATURES

- Really similar controls to the real JSAB!
- Technical level editor which is a paradise for creators!
- Community levels with easy installation!
- Fully accessible open source code!

# HOW TO CLONE/BUILD
TO USE THIS PROJECT, YOU NEED UNITY 6!

Click the Code button and Download ZIP.

Extract the ZIP file and open Unity Hub, click "Add" and click "Add project from disk."

Select the unzipped folder where OSB's at and click your project to open it.

Boom! You've cloned OSB successfully!

## BUILDING

It's very easy. Just build the game as you would any other Unity game.
