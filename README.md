# Open Shapes & Beats

 A JSAB fangame made in Unity

Ever saw JSAB and said "Hey, I completed all the challenges, I played all the levels, now what?" So. Did. We. Well, this game (should) fix the empty void!

# FEATURES

- Technical level editor which is a paradise for creators!
- Community levels with easy installation!
- Fully accessible open source code!

# HOW TO CLONE/BUILD
Open Shapes & Beats uses **Unity 6000.0.41f1**!
It probably won't work with other Unity releases.

1. Clone the GitHub Repo (either through CLI `git clone https://github.com/soyfeo123/open-shapes-and-beats.git` or downloading it through this GitHub page).
2. Add the new OS&B folder to Unity Hub (through the `Add project from disk` button on the top-right corner).
3. Open the project.
4. Make your changes!

## BUILDING

Build it as you would any other Unity game.

**(The currently tested profiles are Windows & macOS.)**

# HOW TO INSTALL

Download the OSAB Installer through [this link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1uSGJBvjabBTWeko2TaIFGmrILmuK3px9).
Alternatively, download the latest version ZIP in the [Releases menu](https://github.com/soyfeo123/open-shapes-and-beats/releases) (be warned that this will not automatically update your game!).
